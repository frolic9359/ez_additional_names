# ez's Additional Character Names

**A lightweight mod that adds lore-friendly names for character creation and NPCs in Starsector.**  
Compatible with version 0.98a and all major mod managers.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What It Does

Adds over **2,600** hand-crafted names to Starsector's in-game name generator, including:

- ~1,700 first names  
- ~1,000 last names  
- 160+ dual-use names (first or last)  
- 409 pirate-only entries with custom nicknames, titles, and callsigns

Names are tagged by in-game **faction category**, so you'll see:

- Religious names for the Luddic Path  
- Harsh, outlaw-style names for Pirates  
- Multicultural "world" names  
- Retrofitted sci-fi and "future" constructs  
- Thematic support for mythic, fringe, and old english categories

- Integrated with [Version Checker](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=8181.0)
